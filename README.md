# Peter's Percy Jackson Mod

> [!CAUTION]
> This mod contains spoilers for various Percy Jackson Books.
> Attempts have been made to hide or obfuscate spoiler content but they will still exist in game.

This mod assumes that you have read, or are not planning on reading at least Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lighting Thief, although it contains content from all 3 major Greek Mythology series by Rick Riordan.

When possible, spoiler warnings are present in documentation for content from specific books, but given the nature of the mod, you might be able to spoil yourself just by playing the mod.

## In Dev Warning

> [!WARNING]
> Forward-compatibility and stability is **NOT** guaranteed for dev builds

This mod is still in early development and features may change.
There is no grantee that that mechanics will continue to function in future version, or that it updating will not corrupt your worlds.
